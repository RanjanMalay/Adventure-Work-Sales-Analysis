# Adventure-Work-Sales-Analysis
Adventure Works Cycles, a global manufacturing company wants to 
design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution – from scratch

Our  client needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional 
performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value customers.
All I’ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, containing information about transactions, 
returns, products, customers and territories.

The project shows the sales insights of a Retail Store which sells millions of products each year.
The Data Set contains sales inputs from year 2015 to 2017. One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. 
I generated a POWER BI based report along with the dashboard to check How the Sales is doing by different segments and how the return affecting the overall Revenue
with respect to each category subcategory and continent annually.

The reports Helps with the Insights:- (1) Total Revenue (2)Total order (3)Total Profit (4) Revenue,Order and return changes MOM (5) Total Order by category and subcategory
